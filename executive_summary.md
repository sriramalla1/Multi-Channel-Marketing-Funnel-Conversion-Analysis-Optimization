### 3. Mobile vs Desktop Performance Gap

**Performance Comparison:**

| Device | Sessions | Conv Rate | Gap |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----|
| Desktop | 33,750 | 12.4% | Baseline |

## 📈 Attribution Model Insights

### Comparison of Attribution Models

We analyzed 5 different attribution models to understand how credit allocation affects channel valuation:

| Model | Description | Best Use Case |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **First-Touch** | 100% credit to first interaction | Measuring awareness/acquisition |
| **Last-Touch** | 100% credit to last interaction | Measuring conversion drivers |
| **Linear** | Equal credit across all touchpoints | Balanced view of journey |
| **Time-Decay** | More recent interactions weighted higher | Emphasizing lower-funnel |
| **Position-Based** | 40% first, 40% last, 20% middle | Balanced awareness + conversion |

**Key Finding:** Attribution model choice significantly impacts budget decisions:
- **Last-Touch** overvalues Paid Search (lower-funnel)
- **First-Touch** overvalues Social Media (upper-funnel)
- **Linear/Position-Based** provide most balanced view

**Recommendation:** Use **Position-Based (40-20-40)** model for budget allocation as it balances awareness generation with conversion driving.
